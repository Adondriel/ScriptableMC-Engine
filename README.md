Scriptable Plugin Engine for Minecraft

Bukkit/Spigot/Paper 1.15.1

Written in Kotlin

This plugin requires running your minecraft server with the GraalVM runtime, this plugin will NOT work with the default java 8 runtime.

A drop-in replacement docker image for `pterodactly/core:java8` is avaliable as `pixlfox/pterodactyl-core:graalvm` on docker hub, or you can manually download and install GraalVM [here](https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/) or [here](https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-ce-builds/releases/latest)
